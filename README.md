# Classical-Chinese-Word-Search-Engine  
This is a repost of a search engine I've made in early 2020. It cames in two version, a webpage and a command line program.  
It is used to help middle school students in China to get prepared for the high school entrance exam. When you search a word in Chinese, it will come up with all sentences with this word in the text book.  
The initial intention I made this program is that many students including myself had difficuties learning classical Chinese literature in my 9th grade, so I decided to use design a program not only to help me study but also to help students with similar issues that I have.
